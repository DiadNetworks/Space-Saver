# Space-Saver
A collection of scripts for clearing storage space on Windows machines.  

The scripts each have a short description of what they do and which variables to edit.  

The purpose for most of these is to have in a server/network environment and either be running on a schedule or used when needed.  

## Categories

There are two categories, these are contained in the folders `Network` and `Local`.  

The `Network` category is for scripts intended to be run in a network environment and they can complete tasks on multiple computers at once.  

The `Local` category is for scripts intended to be run on a single computer when needed to free space.
